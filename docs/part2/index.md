# Part 2 - Problem Solving

In Part 2 we focuse on repetition in programs and how to divide funcionality into distinct units. 

You will learn to recognize certain subproblems such as reading input or calculations recur in programs. You will be aware of different solution models. 

In the exercises you will practice combining solution patterns to solve broader problems.

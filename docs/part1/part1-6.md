# Part 1 - Exercises

## Printing and Reading

The basic structure of the program is given in the exercises.

```cs
using System;

namespace exercise_01
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Add your code here:
            
        }
    }
}
```

### EXERCISE 1-1: Hello World
* Create a program that writes the text **Hello World!** into the console. The program contains the basic structure pictured above.

### EXERCISE 1-2: Bonnie Tyler
* Let's write some more. Bonnie Tyler once sang about feelings. Create a program using 3 Console.WriteLine's that print these lyrics.
  
**Once upon a time**  
**I was falling in love**  
**Now I'm only falling apart**
â€™ ' 
**Now I'm only falling apart**

### EXERCISE 1-3: Bonnie Tyler Line Change
* Let's refine our program. Print the same message. This time use only one Console.WriteLine method. 
  
**Once upon a time**  
**I was falling in love**  
**Now I'm only falling apart**  

### EXERCISE 1-4: First Variable
* The exercise has following structure.

```cs
using System;

namespace exercise_04
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string message = "Passport and floss!";
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}
```

* Change it so that it prints **Passport and a toothbrush!** Do not change the line containing Console.WriteLine. Only change the content of the variable!

### EXERCISE 1-5: Ada Lovelace
* You will find following structure in the exercise.
  
```cs
using System;

namespace exercise_05
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string name = "Ada Lovelace";
            // Write your code here:
            
        }
    }
}
```

* Modify the code so that it prints **Hello Ada LoveLace!** Do not modify the variable content!

### EXERCISE 1-6: Print Input
* Create a program that asks user for a string. After the user has given the string, the program will print the given line. Example output with **Hello** as input. Input is marked with **>** for clarification.

```console
Give input!
> Hello
Hello
```

### EXERCISE 1-7: Triple Hello
* Create a program that asks user for a string. After the user has given the string the program will print the given line 3 times. Example output with **Hello** as input.

```console
Give input!
> Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

### EXERCISE 1-8: Greeting
* Create a program that asks user for their name and greets them. Example output with **Ada** as input.

```console
What is your name?
> Ada
Hello Ada!
```
* Notice the exclamation mark!

### EXERCISE 1-9: Conversation
* Create a program that simulates a small conversation. The program will tell three lines and expects two user inputs.

```console
Hello, how are you?
> Fine, thanks.
That's interesting, tell me more
> I learn coding
Thank you for sharing!
```

### EXERCISE 1-10: Name Profession
* Create a program that asks the user for a name and a profession. Then make the program to write a little story with this information. Here is an example story with inputs **Ada** and **Data Scientist**.

* Notice every **Ada** and **Data Scientist** in the story are the inputs by the user. Remember to save the **Console.ReadLine's** into variables and use them as parts of the story!

```console
I will tell a story, but I need some information.
Give a name for main character:
> Ada
Give the character a profession:
> Data Scientist
Here is the story:
Once upon a time there was a Data Scientist called Ada
On her way to work, Ada often pondered what being Data Scientist meant to them.
When you work as a Data Scientist you meet interesting people.
Ada enjoys their work as Data Scientist, The end.
```

## Variables

### EXERCISE 1-15: Asking Multiple Inputs
* Let's combine everything you know so far. Create program that asks the user for a string, an integer, a double and a boolean and prints them as following.

```console
Give a string:
> This is a masterpiece!
Give an integer:
> 42
Give a double:
> 3.1415

> 7
604800
```

### EXERCISE 1-17: Input Two Integers
* Create a program which asks the user for two integers and calculates their sum.  
* Remember that the input is a string so you have to convert it to integer!

```console
Give the first number!
> 8
Give the second number!
> 3
The sum is 11
```

```console
Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> -1
The sum is 2
```

### EXERCISE 1-18: Input Three Integers
* Expand a little on the previous exercise. Now create a program which asks for three integers and calculates their sum.

```console
Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> -1
Give the third number!
> 2
The sum is 4
```

### EXERCISE 1-19: Sum of Two
* Create a program which asks the user for two integers and counts their sum. This time also print the equation to the user.

```console
Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> 1
3 + 1 = 4
```

```console
Give the first number!
> 5
Give the second number!
> -1
3 + -1 = 2
```

### EXERCISE 1-20: Multiply Two
* Create a program which asks the user for two integers and multiplies them with each other.

```
### EXERCISE 1-22: Average of Three
* Create a program which asks the user for three **integers** and calculates their **average** as a **double**.

```console
Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> 2
Give the third number!
> 1
The average is 2.0
```

### EXERCISE 1-23: Tiny Calculator
* Let's create a program that does all the basic calculations from user input. Ask for two integers and do the calculations with them.

```console
Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> 2
3 + 2 = 5
3 - 2 = 1
3 * 2 = 6
3 / 2 = 1.5
```

That is negative
Give a number:
> 4
16
Give a number:

> -2
Give a number:
> 22
Give a number:
> 0
Total amount of negative numbers: 1
```

### EXERCISE 1-39: Sum of Numbers
* Create a program which asks the user for integers. If the integer is 0 quit. In the end output the total **sum** of the numbers with "Total sum of numbers:" and the sum. Do not count the 0 into the sum.

```console

Give a number:
> -2
Give a number:
> 22
Give a number:
> 0
Total sum of numbers: 25
```

### EXERCISE 1-40: Amount and Sum
* Create a program which asks the user for integers. Exit with 0. In the end output both the amount and the sum. Do not count 0 to either.

```console
Give a number:
> 5
Give a number:
> -2
Give a number:
> 22
Give a number:
> 0
Total sum of numbers: 25
Total amount of numbers: 3
```


* Hint: You will need two variables to store the data. One for the sum and one for the amount.

This site is for enhancing C# programming competence in game development. During the course the students learn basics of programming in C# as well as basics in object oriented programming. Read more about [**the learning goals**](part0).

## Where to Begin

We will be using [**Test My Code (TMC)**](https://tmc.mooc.fi/) programming environment and [**Visual Studio Code (VSC)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) code editor. Start by making an account for TMC and installing the tools. Connect them using [**these instructions**](https://www.mooc.fi/fi/installation/vscode).
